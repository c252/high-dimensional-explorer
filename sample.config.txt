# A Sample HiDEx configuration file. Please read the descriptions of
# each setting carefully before changing the values.

## dbname: Name of the database to be worked on.
## This setting allows one to work with multiple databases in the same
## directory.
dbname=combined

## dbpath: [Optional!] An absolute path for the working directory
## If not set, HiDEx will use the CurrentWorkingDirectory.

# dbpath=/scratch_local/beanstalk/

## dictFilename: Name of the Lexicon file, assumed to be in the Working Directory
dictFilename=lexicon.txt

## maxWindowBehind: Maximum size of word window behind target word
maxWindowBehind=10

## maxWindowAhead: Maximum size of word window ahead of target word
maxWindowAhead=10

## corpusFilename: The filename of the corpus. Assumed to be in the Working Directory.
corpusFilename=corpus1.txt

## stepsize: The number of vectors to collect per pass through the corpus. If
## you run out of memory during an "update", reduce this value. If you find
## that you have more RAM to spare when running update, increase this value.
stepsize=8000

## eod: End of Document marker. Used when processing the corpus.
eod=---END.OF.DOCUMENT---

## outputpath: [Optional] An absolute path for program output. Defaults to
## Current Working Directory.
# outputpath=/scratch_local/jack/

## normalization: Choose your method for vector normalization here. Default is
## co-occurence divided by target word frequency. Other possibilities are PPMI
## (Positive Pointwise Mutual Information) and Correlation.
normalization=PPMI

## weightingScheme: Code number to choose a weighting scheme. The names are
## fairly self explanatory! The original HAL model used #1, Ramped Linear
#  FLAT = 0
#  RAMPED LINEAR = 1
#  RAMPED EXPONENTIAL = 2
#  FORWARD RAMP = 3
#  BACKWARD RAMP = 4
#  INVERSE RAMP = 5
#  INVERSE EXPONENTIAL = 6
#  SECOND WORD = 7
#  THIRD WORD = 8
#  FOURTH WORD = 9
weightingScheme=1

## contextSize: The number of dimensions to use in the co-occurrence
## vector. Only the N most frequent word's vectors are included.
contextSize=14000

## saveGCM: if it is 0, the Global Co-occurrence Matrix will not be saved
## after it is created. If it is 1, a new GCM will be saved to disk every time one is
## created in memory. Saving the GCM can save a lot of processing time if the 
## same parameters are used repeatedly.
saveGCM=0

## metric: Choose your similarity metric here. If it is blank, HiDEx will
## default to using (inverse) Euclidean distance. Other possible values are 
## Cosine and Correlation
metric=Cosine

## windowLenBehind: Size of the window behind the target word. Can be any number from
## 1 to MaxWindowLenBehind. 
windowLenBehind=8

## windowLenAhead: Size of the window behind the target word. Can be any number from
## 1 to MaxWindowLenAhead. 
windowLenAhead=8

## useThreshold: Setting to turn on z-score based neighborhood membership
## thresholds (words more that 1 standard deviation similar than the average
## similarity. 1 means it is ON, 0 means it is OFF.
useThreshold=1

## neighbourhoodSize: When not using neighborhood thresholds, the number of
## neighbors to find. Any number greater than 1
neighbourhoodSize=20

## separate: Enables seperate forward and backward vectors when set to 1. When
## set to 0, Forward and Backward vectors are combined, halving the context size.
separate=1

## percenttosample: When using thresholds, the percent of pairs to sample
## during the calculation of the z-scores. 0.1 means 10%.
percenttosample=0.1

## wordlistfilename: List of words to analyze (can be a list of words, one per
##line, or a list of pairs, two words per line, separated by tabs.
wordlistfilename=words.txt

## wordlistsize: If this number is smaller than the number of words in the
## wordlist, HiDEx will pick a random subset of the words in the wordlistfile
## to use. If this number is larger than the number of words in the
## wordlistfile, HiDEx will use all the words in the file.
wordlistsize=1000
